# Most build_<emu>sa.sh scripts have no verify_action: when builds-alt.sh fails
# to patch or clone something, the copy that follows finds nothing, prints one
# line, and the build moves on. /opt/<name> still exists because mkdir -p ran
# first, so the directory is there and the binary is not. Across two builds that
# quietly cost us ECWolf, Hypseus Singe, GameTank, Yabasanshiro, freej2me-plus
# and Kodi, each discovered only by reading 80k lines of log afterwards.
#
# Rather than hardcode a list of expected binaries that would rot, look for the
# shape of the failure: a directory under /opt holding no executable at all.
#
# Informational only - never fails the build. Reads Arkbuild/, so it has to run
# before cleanup_filesystem.sh.
