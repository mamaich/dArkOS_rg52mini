# darkos-androidroms - ROMs from the Android storage on a dual-boot card.
#
# On the combined "dArkOS + GammaOS" SD card there is no ROMS partition: the
# games live in Android's shared storage, /storage/emulated/0/ROMs, which on
# disk is media/0/ROMs inside the userdata partition (ext4 with casefold). This
# mounts userdata (by its GPT partition label, on the card dArkOS runs from)
# at /mnt/androiddata and binds
# the ROMs folder to /roms and its tools folder to /opt/system/Tools, before
# EmulationStation starts. /boot/dualboot marks such a card; without it this
# does nothing.
#
# Access: Android keeps media/0 setgid to group 1023 (media_rw) with a default
# ACL giving that group rwx, so ark only needs to be in a group with gid 1023.
# What ark creates there gets group 1023 and group rw by itself, and Android
# reads and writes it. Avoid chmod without group bits there: it narrows the
# ACL mask and takes Android's write access away.
#
# Until Android has started once, userdata is not formatted: then /roms stays
# an empty local folder, the boot goes on, and the next boot picks it up.
