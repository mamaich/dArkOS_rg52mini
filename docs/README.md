# RG52 Mini port notes

Working notes for this fork of [bmdhacks/dArkOS_rg52mini](https://github.com/bmdhacks/dArkOS_rg52mini),
which is itself a fork of [christianhaitian/dArkOS](https://github.com/christianhaitian/dArkOS).

They exist so the next person — or the next AI session — starts from what is
already known instead of rediscovering it. Where something was measured on
hardware it says so; where it is inference it says that too.

| | |
|---|---|
| [BUILDING.md](BUILDING.md) | environment, the WSL story, how to run a build |
| [HARDWARE.md](HARDWARE.md) | the kernel patches and what they fixed |
| [KNOWN-ISSUES.md](KNOWN-ISSUES.md) | what is missing from the image and why |
| [PERFORMANCE.md](PERFORMANCE.md) | what actually makes emulators faster here |
| [TODO.md](TODO.md) | what is next, and what is waiting on the next build |

## The device

    SoC       Rockchip RK3562, 4x Cortex-A53 @ 2.0 GHz, ARMv8.0-A
    GPU       Mali-G52 (Bifrost), vendor blob g29p1
    RAM       2 GB
    Panel     DSI 720x1280 portrait, console rotated (fbcon=rotate:1)
    Wi-Fi/BT  AIC8800D80, one combo part over SDIO (mmc2)
    PMIC      RK817 — regulators, codec, charger, fuel gauge
    Type-C    HUSB311 (Hynetek) on i2c@ffa10000, address 0x4e
    eMMC      3.7 GB: uboot, trust, emuelec, swap(256M), STORAGE, eeroms
    Boot      from SD: GPT, p3 FAT32 with extlinux, Image, DTB, uInitrd

The chip is marked D40 but answers as D80 over SDIO (vid `0xC8A1`,
did `0x0082`), and only the D80 code path works.

## Repositories

This fork pins its own submodules, so a fresh clone reproduces a build without
any manual steps:

    mamaich/dArkOS_rg52mini
      kernel_rk3562      -> mamaich/kernel_rk3562        four hardware patches
      rk3562_core_builds -> mamaich/rk3566_core_builds   Cortex-A53 build flags
      bootloader         -> bmdhacks/aislpc-bootloader-tool

Clone with `--recursive`. All three are https; an earlier `git@github.com:`
in `.gitmodules` meant submodules only resolved for people with an SSH key.

## State of the port

Verified on the device over SSH, 2026-09-16:

| | |
|---|---|
| Wi-Fi | works |
| Bluetooth | works — `hci0 Type: Primary Bus: SDIO`, scanning finds devices |
| USB host | works — a USB mouse enumerates, HID binds, input node appears |
| Speaker | works once `Playback Path` is `SPK`; that is now the default |
| Swap | zram 1.5 GB at priority 100, eMMC partition at 10, both active |
| Kernel modules | 6.3 MB, stripped of debug info (was 100 MB) |

Bluetooth and USB host are the two things the upstream port cannot do. Both
come from the device tree and driver changes described in
[HARDWARE.md](HARDWARE.md).

Not yet verified: whether the speaker click on playback start/stop is gone
(the GPIO behaves correctly, which is necessary but not sufficient), and
whether the Amiga emulator runs — it was built with an instruction set its
CPU does not have until recently, see KNOWN-ISSUES.
